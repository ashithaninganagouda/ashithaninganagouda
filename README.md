**PROJECT 2**

**Data-Driven Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Using K-Means Clustering**
**Project Statement**
The goal of this project is to understand the target customer base for the marketing team to better plan their strategies. By identifying the most important customer groups based on demographic and behavioral criteria such as age, gender, income, and mall shopping score, we aim to provide actionable insights for market segmentation. This will allow the marketing team to tailor their activities and improve customer engagement and satisfaction.

**Objective**
**Market Segmentation**
The primary objective of this project is to divide the mall's target market into approachable and meaningful segments. By creating subsets of the market based on demographic and behavioral criteria, we can better understand and target specific groups for marketing activities. This process involves:

-  Demographic Segmentation: Analyzing age, gender, and income to identify key customer segments.
-  Behavioral Segmentation: Using the mall shopping score to group customers based on their shopping behavior.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**
The first step involves collecting and preprocessing the customer data. This includes handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
-  Load the raw dataset.
-  Handle missing values and outliers.
-  Normalize/standardize numerical features.
-  Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender).


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step to understand the underlying patterns and distributions in the data. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data and visualizing relationships between different variables.
-  Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., for numerical features.
-  Distribution Analysis: Visualize the distribution of age, income, and mall shopping scores.
-  Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between different features using heatmaps.
-  Pairwise Relationships: Use pair plots to explore relationships between multiple variables.
 
**Univariate Clustering**
Univariate clustering involves performing K-Means clustering on a single feature to identify clusters based on that feature alone.
-  Select a single feature (e.g., annual income).
-  Perform K-Means clustering.
-  Visualize the clusters using histograms or scatter plots.
-  Interpret the clusters.

**Bivariate Clustering**
Bivariate clustering involves performing K-Means clustering on two features simultaneously to explore how they interact to form distinct customer groups.
-  Select two features (e.g., annual income and mall shopping score).
-  Perform K-Means clustering.
-  Visualize the clusters using scatter plots.
-  Interpret the clusters.

**Multivariate Clustering**
Multivariate clustering involves using multiple features for clustering to capture a more comprehensive view of customer behavior and demographics.
-  Select multiple features (e.g., age, gender, annual income, mall shopping score).
-  Perform K-Means clustering.
-  Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) for visualization if necessary.
-  Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or 3D plots.
-  Interpret the clusters.
 
**Visualization and Interpretation**
Visualization and interpretation of the clustering results are essential to communicate the findings effectively. This includes creating detailed visualizations and summarizing insights.
-  Create scatter plots, bar charts, and other visualizations to display the clusters.
-  Summarize the findings in a detailed report.
-  Provide actionable insights based on the identified customer segments.

**Tools**
-  Seaborn: For creating scatter plots, pair plots, and bar charts.
-  Matplotlib: For basic visualizations and customization.
-  Pandas: For data manipulation and summary statistics.
-  Sklean: For normalizing numerical features in the dataset, ensuring consistent scales for accurate clustering analysis.
  
**Results**
The clustering analysis identifies Cluster 1 as the most lucrative segment, characterized by high-income individuals with a propensity for high spending, with approximately 54% being women shoppers. Tailored marketing campaigns should focus on personalized services, exclusive offers, and loyalty programs to retain and attract these high-value customers. Additionally, targeting popular items favored by this cluster can further enhance customer engagement and drive revenue growth. Cluster 2, comprising customers with lower income and spending score, presents an opportunity for targeted sales events to stimulate spending on popular items and increase overall sales volume. By leveraging these insights, the mall can optimize marketing strategies and improve overall business performance.
